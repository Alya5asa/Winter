<h1>The Start of the Chaotic Smp</h1>
<h3>The Chaotic smp or Csmp for short, is a lore story idea that would be played out in minecarft. Started at the year 2021, the csmp didn't really used the name 'csmp' back when it started. It happens to be a more to of a split and combined. For this to make more sense, we will be explaining the first early groups of the csmp that been made and maybe plus the groups that the Csmp also has.</h3>
